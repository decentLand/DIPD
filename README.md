# DIPD
DAO's Improvement Proposals Discussion
# Synopsis
DAO's Improvement Proposals Discussion or DIPD is a new under planning/development feature for decentland protocol in order to provide on-chain, sized, and a better way to discuss a DAO's IP (improvement proposal).
# Motivation
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) lack from decentralization when it comes to provide a decentralized enclosed discussion-lobby for the DAO members only. While third-app services are used (e.g Slack, Telegram, Discord, etc) for a proposal's discussion, several problems rise like: anti-Coummunity-guidelines members giving their opinions, spam, a fifth column, etc.

To prevent such issues, DAO's core team used to create private groups/channels to ensure DAO's membership, and user's selectivity.

# DIPD Post
DIPD represents a new `action` (equivalent to type meaning) of decentland post's transaction. A standard Tribus post has an `"action", "post"` tag to get identified as a normal post transaction. Unlike the classic-post, a DIPD post has an essential top-level tag: `"action", "DIPD-Init"`
